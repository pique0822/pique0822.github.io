For this project, I led the development of the underlying Docker container that runs the prediction.   As owner, I was tasked with managing stakeholders, developing best practices for the project, writing tons of scripts, working with the AWS stack (such as ECR and S3), and post-deployment maintainance.   <br/>  <a href=\"https://docs.rev.ai/api/language-identification/get-started/\">API Documentation</a>  <br/>  "
